# Git Rules

## Commits
- Commit after EVERY working feature. Small, frequent commits.
- Format: `type: short description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `data`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Examples:
  - `feat: add elasticsearch connection with health check`
  - `data: generate 800 synthetic feedback items`
  - `fix: bulk ingest error handling for partial failures`
  - `docs: add architecture diagram to README`

## Branches
- Work on `main` for hackathon speed. No branch overhead for 1 person.
- If trying something risky, commit first, then experiment. Revert if it breaks.

## .gitignore Must Include
```
.env
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store
node_modules/
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/
.vscode/
```

## Never Commit
- .env with real API keys
- Large data files (>10MB)
- IDE settings
- Compiled Python files
